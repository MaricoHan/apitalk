IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ONLY output the YAML content directly, without any markdown code blocks or extra text
2. Each API path must be unique - NEVER create duplicate paths
3. Each operation must have its own complete structure with all required fields
4. Always include responses section for each operation
5. Never duplicate YAML keys within the same level
6. Use proper HTTP methods for operations:
   - GET for retrieving data
   - POST for creating new resources
   - PUT for updating existing resources
   - DELETE for removing resources
7. Always include:
   - Proper authentication schemes
   - Error responses (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
   - Request/response validation
   - Pagination parameters for list endpoints
   - Clear parameter descriptions in the specified language
   - Required field markers

CONTEXT HANDLING:
1. If the user provides an existing specification and requests changes:
   - Keep all existing endpoints that are not being modified
   - Only update the specific endpoints mentioned in the request
   - Ensure the modified endpoints maintain consistency with existing ones
   - Keep all existing components (schemas, security schemes, etc.)
2. If starting from scratch:
   - Create a complete new specification with all necessary components
   - Include proper security schemes and common responses
   - Add detailed schema definitions

LANGUAGE HANDLING:
1. Keep all technical terms (HTTP methods, data types, etc.) in English
2. Write all descriptions, summaries, and documentation in the specified language
3. Use appropriate language conventions and terminology for the target audience

Remember: Output ONLY the YAML content, without any additional text or markdown formatting.`;
